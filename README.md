## ApexAI: Virtual Racing Simulator with AI Optimization
ApexAI is an innovative virtual racing simulator that utilizes advanced artificial intelligence techniques to generate the most efficient racing lines on diverse tracks. The project leverages the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) framework to evolve AI behavior, optimizing decision-making and performance in dynamic racing scenarios. ApexAI won the Best Overall Project at the UT Formula Hackathon.

### Features
AI Optimization: Uses the NEAT algorithm to evolve neural network topologies, improving AI decision-making for generating optimal racing lines.
Real-Time Simulation: A comprehensive simulation environment that tests and evolves AI strategies in real-time for continuous improvement.
User Interface: Intuitive interface allowing users to interact with the AI, observe races, and analyze the AIâ€™s performance and decision-making.
Award-Winning: Recognized as the Best Overall Project at the UT Formula Hackathon.
How It Works
Neural Network Evolution: The NEAT framework evolves neural networks by adjusting both weights and topologies over generations to improve racing line efficiency.
Track Variability: The AI is tested across various race tracks with different layouts, requiring dynamic adjustments in driving strategy.
Interactive UI: Users can observe AI performance, review racing outcomes, and analyze key decisions made by the AI during the race.
